# Excel-Kuringgai-pros-and-cons

### Project Overview
This project analysed long-term median house price trends in Ku-ring-gai and compared them with Greater Sydney and neighbouring LGAs to evaluate investment attractiveness.

The objective was to assess:

Long-term capital growth

Volatility and risk exposure

Dwelling-type dependency

Relative affordability

### Analytical Approach
Using Excel, I conducted:

Time-series trend analysis (1991–2017)

Growth rate comparisons by dwelling type (strata vs non-strata)

Cross-LGA benchmarking (Greater Sydney, Manly)

Volatility comparison

### Key Findings
1. Strong Long-Term Growth

Ku-ring-gai demonstrated consistent long-term price appreciation across both strata and non-strata dwellings.

2. High Volatility

Compared to Greater Sydney, Ku-ring-gai exhibited higher percentage price fluctuations, increasing investment risk.

3. Heavy Reliance on Non-Strata Growth

Approximately 70%+ of growth was driven by non-strata dwellings, indicating concentration risk.

4. Affordability Barrier

Median prices have remained among the highest since 1991, limiting accessibility and potentially reducing buyer liquidity.

5. Post-2017 Slowdown

From 2017–2021, growth moderated. While prices continued to increase slightly, affordability pressure intensified.

### Strategic Implications
High capital growth potential, but elevated volatility risk.

Investment returns depend heavily on detached housing performance.

Entry costs are significantly higher than surrounding LGAs.

Risk-adjusted return may be less attractive for conservative investors.

### Recommendation
Ku-ring-gai is suitable for investors with higher risk tolerance seeking long-term capital appreciation.

However, due to:

High volatility

Affordability barriers

Growth concentration risk

It may not be optimal for risk-averse investors compared to more balanced LGAs.
Post-2017 CPI-adjusted reflection analysis

Charts and growth calculations were used to identify structural patterns and risk signals.
